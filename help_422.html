<P> 

<P> There&rsquo;s something missing in our scripts, and the easiest place to see this is in an ordinary function call:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(2, pi)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Realizing that commas are just ends-of-lines, we could write this

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pi

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  which shows that <tt>2</tt> and <tt>pi</tt> are somehow valid commands.  How can this be?

<P> Let&rsquo;s draw an analogy.  Back in the cave man days, there were probably a lot of sentences like

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rock

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  which in modern English would be written

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [That which I want to draw your attention to] [is] the rock.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  In other words, if a sentence only contains an object, the cave man&rsquo;s brain fills it out by adding some stock subject and verb.  Cicada works exactly the same way:  the stock &lsquo;subjects and verbs&rsquo; to use in different situations are the so-called adapters defined in <tt>cicada.c</tt>.  Each adapter allows the compiler to convert some bare expression (analogous to the object of a sentence) to another type (perhaps a &lsquo;sentence&rsquo; type), at the price of adding a few bytecode words.  This prevents a type-mismatch error from being thrown by incomplete expressions.

<P> For example, when the user enters the command &lsquo;<tt>2</tt>&rsquo;, the compiler rolls its eyes and reaches for the type-mismatch error button, because it expected a complete command (a type 1 expression) whereas an <tt>int_constant</tt> can only be construed as types 4, 5 or 6 based on its return-types string in the <tt>cicadaLanguage[]</tt> array.  But then Cicada notices an adapter that works on type-5 objects (called <tt>type5arg_adapter</tt> in <tt>cicada.c</tt>), and moreover that adapter&rsquo;s return-types string includes a &ldquo;1&rdquo; which is what we want.  So the adapter adds its code and the error never happens.  Here is the adapter&rsquo;s bytecode:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inbytecode &quot;8 173 10&quot; anonymousmember &quot;a1&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  The expression to adapt is considered the &lsquo;argument&rsquo; and goes in place of <tt>a1</tt>.  Looking at <tt>cicada.h</tt> or the reference section, we could figure out that this adapter turns our expression into something looking like

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1 := 2

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  except that the define-equate operator has slightly different define flags (173 instead of 47).  Likewise the expression &lsquo;<tt>pi</tt>&rsquo; requires a different adapter that looks like

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var2 := @pi

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  though again with slightly different flags on the aliasing operator.  A third adapter with a define-like operator creates composite objects, and allows statements like <tt>myVar = { 1, false }</tt>.

<P> The <tt>anonymousmember</tt> keyword is a unique member &lsquo;name&rsquo;, which is inexpressible by any user.  (The reason is that members the user types are translated into positive member ID numbers in bytecode, whereas anonymous members are assigned sequential negative ID numbers.)  Thus the members we represented as <tt>var1</tt> and <tt>var2</tt> in the last paragraph really don&rsquo;t have those names or any other, so they can only be accessed by index using the bracket operators <tt>[...]</tt>.  (Or by &lsquo;name&rsquo;/ID number if we are willing to write our own bytecode.)

<P> Incidentally, anonymous members are also used in ordinary function calls, and in this case those members are also &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; because their define operators have the hidden-member flag set.  The hidden flag causes these members to be invisible to the array-index operators:  they can only be accessed by &lsquo;name&rsquo; (a.k.a. ID number).  The variables behind these members become the <tt>args</tt> variables when functions are run.  If it helps, think of a function call <tt>f(2, pi)</tt> as if the syntax were <tt>f{2, pi}</tt>, having braces denoting the argument variable.

<P> The exotic define operator flags used by function calls are listed in Table 3.  The rarest bird in this collection, abbreviated <tt>def-c**</tt> (&lsquo;hidden-define-minus-constructor&rsquo;), lives exclusively in the function call of a <tt>trap()</tt> function, defining the <tt>args</tt> variable <i>without running its constructor</i> so that <tt>trap()</tt> can do this in a controlled way.

<P> The adapters consistently set the unjammable flag of their define/equate-at operators, preventing them from jamming arrays.  For example, if we call <tt>f(myArray[&lt;2, 4&gt;])</tt> we will still be able to resize <tt>myArray</tt> in the future, and the broken link will be refreshed next time that call to <tt>f()</tt> is made because that reruns the argument constructor.  (In sets this can cause a problem, because the set&rsquo;s constructor is not usually rerun after an array resize.  We can get around this by manually aliasing a member to certain array indices.)  Also, the update-members flag is cleared by all of the adapters, so that the anonymous member can be re-assigned to a variable of a different type (for example if between two iterations of the command <tt>f(a)</tt> member &lsquo;<tt>a</tt>&rsquo; gets removed and redefined).

<P> One last type of adapter called <tt>noarg_adapter</tt> replaces missing expressions altogether.  These adapters are necessary to allow blank scripts, or expressions like &lsquo;<tt>,,</tt>&rsquo; where no command appeared between the commas, since each comma expects a sentence-type argument.  A final no-argument-adapter allows a script to contain a <tt>return</tt> command without a variable.

<P> Notice that the final set of adapters in <tt>cicada.c/cpp</tt> is used to convert a sentences-type expression (type 1) to a script expression (type 0), by adding a null bytecode word at the end.<P>
