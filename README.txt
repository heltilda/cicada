Cicada script is a simple, interpreted language that can be extended with the user's own C/C++ code.  For details, see the website:

Building Cicada requires a machine with a command prompt, a C or C++ compiler and the 'make' tool.

To compile using the Make tool:
1. Open the command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory in which Cicada's source files are located.
3. Compile as follows, depending on whether we want to use the C or C++ compiler.
  * To compile as C, type:  "make cicada CC=gcc"
  * To compile as C++, type:  "make cicada"

To run, use a command prompt to navigate to Cicada and type "/.cicada" (UNIX) or just "cicada" (DOS).
