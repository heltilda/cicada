<BODY>



<P>   The second type of variable in Cicada is a composite variable, equivalent to a structure variable in C.  Composite variables are collections of <i>members</i> defined inside of curly braces, just like a struct variable in C.  Member definitions can go on their own lines, but make sure the opening brace is on the first line.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StreetAddress :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number :: int

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;street :: string

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  If we don&rsquo;t care about the member names we can leave them out.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StreetAddress :: { int, string }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  <tt>StreetAddress</tt> is a proper variable with its own storage, but for convenience Cicada allows us to also treat it as a new data type.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PetersPlace :: StreetAddress

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  In general any Cicada variable <tt>A</tt> can be used to define other variables <tt>B</tt> and <tt>C</tt>, which just copy <tt>A</tt>&rsquo;s type definition (although not <tt>A</tt>&rsquo;s data).

<P> We access members of a composite variable the same way in Cicada as we do in C:  using a period.  For example (using the original definition with member names):

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PetersPlace.number = 357

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PetersPlace.street = &quot;Bumbleberry Drive&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P> Composite variables may be nested inside one another, either using previously-defined types or by nesting curly braces.  Here is an example showing both methods.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FullAddress :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first_line :: StreetAddress

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second_line :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city :: state :: string

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zip :: int

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  In this case, we need to use a &lsquo;<tt>.</tt>&rsquo; twice to access any of the primitive fields.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FullAddress.first_line.number = 357

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Notice that members of composite variables can also serve as data types.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GeneralWhereabouts :: FullAddress.second_line

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GeneralWhereabouts.city = &quot;Detroit&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P> One peculiarity of composite variables is that their internal structures can be rearranged after they have been defined.  For example:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PaulineAddress :: FullAddress

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove PaulineAddress.first_line.street&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| it's a PO box

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PaulineAddress.country :: string&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| in another country

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  By the end <tt>PaulineAddress</tt> will have a three members including one named <tt>country</tt>, and the <tt>street</tt> member of <tt>first_line</tt> will be missing.  One thing to be aware of is that if we ever use a modified variable like <tt>PaulineAddress</tt> to define another variable:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PaulineOldAddress :: PaulineAddress

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  the new variable is always defined using the <i>original</i> definition.  So <tt>PaulineOldAddress</tt> will not have a member named <tt>country</tt> and it will have <tt>street</tt> inside of <tt>first_line</tt>.  This can lead to problems with the define-equate operator:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; PaulinesDogAddress := PaulineAddress

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error:&nbsp;type mismatch

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  The problem was that the define half of <tt>:=</tt> constructed <tt>PaulinesDogAddress</tt> based on the original type definition of <tt>PaulineAddress</tt>, while the equate half of <tt>:=</tt> copies data from the fields that are actually present between the two variables.  Oops.

<P> Assignment and equality-testing work with whole composite variables just like they do with primitive variables:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom :: Bob :: StreetAddress

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom = Bob

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Tom == Bob&nbsp;then (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| yes, they will be equal

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(&quot;They're sharing a room.\n&quot;)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  We were allowed to assign and compare <tt>Tom</tt> and <tt>Bob</tt> because they have the same { number, string } structure.

<P> Numeric operations and comparisons do not work with composite variables, even if all their members are numeric.  Expressions like <tt>Tom+Bob</tt> and <tt>Tom &gt; Bob</tt> will always cause an error.
