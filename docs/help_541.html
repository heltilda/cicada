<BODY>



<P> The <tt>start.cicada</tt> script provides an interactive command prompt, while keeping most of its internal functions hidden from the user.  However, a few of its variables and functions have aliases inside the user&rsquo;s workspace, and those are the focus of this section.<P>

<P> 

<br><P><b><tt>calculator</b></tt>:</b>
<P> is a function that prints the results of incomplete expressions at the command line.  An incomplete expression is one that is not assigned to a variable, or used in any other way.  For example, if the user types

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = 5 + 2

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  then nothing will be printed, regardless of whether <tt>calculator</tt> is on or off.  However, if the user were to enter just

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 + 2

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  then the answer &lsquo;7&rsquo; will be printed, thanks to the calculator.

<P> To be completely technical, the calculator prints the data of all hidden members created by the user.  Since these members will never be used again <tt>start.cicada</tt> removes them after each command from the user, but only after asking the calculator to print them first.  The calculator is only a printing function, not a calculator per-se.

<P> By default, the calculator is aliased to <tt>user.cicada</tt>&rsquo;s <tt>sprint()</tt> function.  We can change the output style by aliasing it to another printing function:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; calculator = @mprint

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Or, if calculator is getting annoying (e.g. printing the output of functions we don&rsquo;t care about, or that return enormous blocks of data), we can turn it off altogether:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; calculator = @nothing

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P> 

<P> 

<br><P><b><tt>ans</b></tt>:</b>
<P>:  short for &ldquo;answer&rdquo;.  This is aliased to whatever the calculator last printed (void if the calculator hasn&rsquo;t printed anything yet).  Use <tt>ans</tt> like any other variable:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 2+5

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; ans*2

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P> 

<P> 

<br><P><b><tt>allNames</b></tt>:</b>
<P>  the list of member names that have been defined so far, including those defined in <tt>start.cicada</tt>.  <tt>allNames</tt> is updated with every new command-line prompt, or every time the user calls <tt>compile()</tt> with <tt>allNames</tt> as the fourth argument.  This list is used by <tt>user.cidada</tt>&rsquo;s <tt>go()</tt> and <tt>what()</tt> functions.

<P> 

<br><P><b><tt>go_path[]</b></tt>:</b>
<P>  a set of aliases to each composite object in the search path, beginning with <tt>root</tt> and ending with the current working variable.  <tt>start.cicada</tt> uses <tt>go_path</tt> to form the search path for each command entered by the user.  Both <tt>go()</tt> and <tt>jump()</tt> work by modifying <tt>go_path</tt>, and <tt>start.cicada</tt> will reset <tt>go_path</tt> if it detects a problem.  The user can add a small coding section to <tt>go_path</tt> which <tt>start.cicada</tt> will run if it needs to reset the path; in this coding section do not define any variables or run any functions or problems will start happening.<P><P>
