<P> There is no <tt>break</tt> statement in Cicada.  But there is a way to jerry-rig something that does pretty much the same.  The trick is to put braces -- with no <tt>code</tt> marker or semicolon -- around the code we eventually want to escape from.  Within those braces, a <tt>return</tt> statement will simply escape from the bracketed code and continue with what follows.  For example:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for counter in &lt;1, 10&gt;&nbsp;(

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(counter)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if input() == &quot;q&quot;&nbsp;then return&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(&quot;finished with counter = &quot;, counter)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  This works because the braces define a new composite variable, and the code inside the braces is actually running inside of this variable.  Be wary of pitfalls:  if we define a member, that member will be inside of this variable, which was probably not intended.  &lsquo;<tt>this</tt>&rsquo; now refers to this newly-defined variable, while &lsquo;<tt>parent</tt>&rsquo; now refers to the location outside the braces.  Also, if this is all inside of a function definition, we can&rsquo;t return from the function until we leave the braces block.  On the upside, we have a lot of latitude in choosing where to break from and to:  it doesn&rsquo;t have to escape from a loop, and we can jump out of several nested loops at once unlike in C where we always fall back to the enclosing loop.
