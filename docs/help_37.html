<BODY>

 

<P> One object in Cicada that is not supported by C is the <i>set</i>.  A set is basically a magical bag of assorted items---variables, functions, classes, even other sets---that also exist somewhere else.  To define a set we write curly braces around a list of objects separated by commas (or end-of-lines).  Here is an example where each object is in several places.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice :: Bob :: Christine :: Daniel :: Elan :: friend_of_mine

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men :: { Daniel, Elan, Bob }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neighbors :: { Christine, Bob }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cleaning_schedule :: { Bob, Alice, Bob, Alice, Elan, Elan, Daniel }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  We typically access members of a set using square brackets (as if they were arrays).  So after running the code, <tt>Bob</tt>, <tt>men[3]</tt>, <tt>neighbors[2]</tt>, <tt>cleaning_schedule[1]</tt> and <tt>cleaning_schedule[3]</tt> are all the same thing.  If we set <tt>men[3].needsSleep = true</tt> then <tt>Bob.needsSleep</tt> and <tt>neighbors[2].needsSleep</tt> will also be <tt>true</tt>.  Notice how the same object can even appear in several places in a set.  Sets come handy when the objects have convoluted path names.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to_buy :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food.produce.fruits.apples

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes.shoes.black

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes.socks.black

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  <tt>to_buy[1]</tt> is much quicker than <tt>food.produce.fruits.apples</tt>.

<P> Cicada sets are pretty flexible in what they can store.  Along with variables, we can throw constants, other sets (including ones that we define on the fly), and even the void into the bag.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collections :: { men, neighbors, { Patty, Don }, &quot;Herbert&quot;, 3.3, this[3], this, nothing }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Here <tt>collections[3]</tt> is an inlined subset containing two objects.  The fourth and fifth items are inlined constants.  The <tt>collections[6]</tt> <i>is</i> also the third item, the subset containing <tt>Patty</tt> and <tt>Don</tt>, and notice that it had to be listed after the third item because otherwise <tt>this[3]</tt> would not have existed yet.  <tt>collections[7]</tt> is <tt>collections</tt> itself -- so <tt>collections[7][7][7][2]</tt> is just <tt>neighbors</tt>.  Trying to print <tt>collections</tt> from the command line won&rsquo;t work because of the self reference.

<P> The reason we access set elements by their index (as opposed to name) is that those set elements <i>have no name</i>, at least the way we defined them in our examples.  In other words, <tt>collections[1]</tt> is effectively an alias for <tt>men</tt> but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that that set element has the name <tt>men</tt> -- <tt>collection.men</tt> will cause Cicada to draw a blank.  But there is actually a way to name certain elements of a set, and that is to manually define aliases for their respective objects.  To illustrate, here we give a different way of defining <tt>collections</tt> which assigns names to members 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collections :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbors := @parent.neighbors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| use same name for convenience

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peeps :: { Patty, Don }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herby := &quot;Herbert&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3,&nbsp;this[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| set elements 5 and 6

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself := @this

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zilch := @nothing

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  With the verbose definition we can write <tt>collections.Herby</tt> in place of <tt>collections[4]</tt>, although <tt>collections[4]</tt> is still perfectly legal.

<P> Just as with composite variables, items can be added to and removed from sets after they have been defined.  So if we want to shuffle &ldquo;<tt>Herbert</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo; to the end of the set we might write:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collections[top+1] := @collections.Herby

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove collections.Herby

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  (and those 2 lines could go in any order).

<P> As with variables, we can use one set to define another.  The following is legal:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newCollections :: collections

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Importantly, <tt>newCollections</tt> is defined using the old set <tt>collections</tt>&rsquo;s <i>original</i> definition.  So even if we had rearranged the elements of <tt>collections</tt>, in the new set <tt>Herbert</tt> will be both at <tt>newCollections[4]</tt> and <tt>newCollections.Herby</tt>.  We might as well have defined both sets on the same line:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newCollections :: collections :: { ... }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>
