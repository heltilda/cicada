<P> There is no <tt>break</tt> statement in Cicada.  But there is a way to jerry-rig something that does pretty much the same.  The trick is to put braces -- with no <tt>code</tt> marker or semicolon -- around the code we eventually want to escape from.  Within those braces, a <tt>return</tt> statement will simply escape from the bracketed code and continue with what follows.  For example:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for counter in &lt;1, 10&gt;&nbsp;(

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(counter)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if input() == &quot;q&quot;&nbsp;then return&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print(&quot;finished with counter = &quot;, counter)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  This works because the braces actually define a new composite variable, and the code inside the braces is actually running inside of this variable.  This causes problems in some cases.  If we define a member, that member will be inside of this variable, which was probably not intended.  The <tt>this</tt> keyword refers to this newly-defined variable, while <tt>parent</tt> now refers to the place we were before hitting the braces.  Also, if we had been running a function, we cannot escape this function using a <tt>return</tt> statement within the bracketed code.  On the upside, we have a lot of latitude in choosing where to put the braces:  it doesn&rsquo;t have to escape from a loop, and if we do use them inside loops it does not have to be to the next-outermost <tt>for</tt> or <tt>while</tt>.
