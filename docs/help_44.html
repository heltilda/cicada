</HEAD>

<BODY>



<P> The distinction between member type and variable type motivates two further define operators.<P>

<P> The variable-define operator &lsquo;<tt>@::</tt>&rsquo; is identical to ordinary define (<tt>::</tt>), except that it only sets the target variable&rsquo;s type, while leaving the member&rsquo;s type unchanged.  That means that if it is used to define a brand new member, that member&rsquo;s type will be void.  For example, here we use this operator to define and then redefine a member with different types of storage, and then alias it to another variable of a different type.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theVar @:: int

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theVar = @nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| need to unlink before creating a new variable

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theVar @:: string

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theBool :: bool

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theVar = @theBool

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Notice that the second <tt>@::</tt> operator was forced to make a new variable because <tt>theVar</tt> had been unlinked (aliased to the void) on the previous line.  Had we left out the unlinking command, Cicada would have tried to redefine the existing <tt>int</tt> <i>variable</i> as a <tt>string</tt>, causing a type-mismatch error.

<P> The member-define operator &lsquo;<tt>*::</tt>&rsquo; is the counterpart to variable-define:  it only acts upon the member, without affecting any variable currently aliased by this member.  Its symbol reflects the fact that, if one uses member-define to define a new member, it will indeed create a member of the desired type but it will not bother to create a variable for it:  the member will point into the void.  So the following code will cause an error:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myNum *:: int

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myNum = 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| will cause an error

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  which could have been avoided had we written <tt>myNum :: int</tt> or <tt>myNum @:: int</tt> between the two lines, in order to construct an integer variable for the member.

<P> There are actually 256 possible define/equate/alias operators, most of which cannot be scripted directly unless we modify the language.  See Section 5.<P>

<P> Finally, there is another assignment operator called &lsquo;forced-equate&rsquo;, and given the symbol &lsquo;<tt>=!</tt>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<tt>&lt;-!</tt>&rsquo;.  While equate copies data between variables whose data structures match or are compatible (e.g. <tt>{ int, string }</tt> to <tt>{ double, string }</tt>), forced equate copies between variables having the same memory storage size.  (Having a string or other list in the destination variable makes the storage requirement somewhat elastic.)  A forced equate simply takes the data contained in its right-hand argument and stuffs those <i>N</i> bytes in the same order into the left-hand variable, with no restrictions on how the storage space is parceled out within the destination variable.

<P> When forcing an equate from data having numeric constants, remember that Cicada interprets each written number as either as <tt>int</tt> or <tt>double</tt>.  So for example, if long integers are 4 bytes and doubles are 8 bytes, <tt>a =! -4</tt> and <tt>a =! 2e5</tt> each copy 4 bytes while <tt>a =! 4.</tt> and <tt>a =! 2e10</tt> each copy 8 bytes.

<P> Here are some examples showing the difference between these two operators:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1 :: { int, bool }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var2 :: { double, bool }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var3 :: { int, string }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1 = var2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| OK

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1 = var3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| type-mismatch error

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1 =! var2&nbsp;&nbsp;| unequal data size error

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1 =! var3&nbsp;&nbsp;| unequal data size error unless string has 1 character

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var3 =! var1&nbsp;&nbsp;| OK, surprisingly!

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  The last line works because forced-equate resizes <tt>var3</tt>&rsquo;s string as needed to soak up any extra bytes from <tt>var1</tt>.
