<BODY>

 

<P> Sets are like magical bags of objects that are also found somewhere else in the code:  variables, functions, classes, other sets, whatever.  To define a set we write curly braces around a list of objects separated by commas (or end-of-lines).  Here is an example where each object is in several places.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice :: Bob :: Christine :: Daniel :: Joe :: friend_of_mine

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men :: { Daniel, Joe, Bob }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neighbors :: { Christine, Bob }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cleaning_schedule :: { Bob, Alice, Bob, Alice, Joe, Joe, Daniel }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  We can access members of a set using square brackets (as if they were arrays).  So after running the code, <tt>Bob</tt>, <tt>men[3]</tt>, <tt>neighbors[2]</tt>, <tt>cleaning_schedule[1]</tt> and <tt>cleaning_schedule[3]</tt> are all the same thing.  If we set <tt>men[3].needsSleep = true</tt> then <tt>Bob.needsSleep</tt> and <tt>neighbors[2].needsSleep</tt> will also be <tt>true</tt>.  Notice how the same object can even appear in several places in a set.  Sets come handy when the objects have convoluted path names.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to_buy :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food.produce.fruits.apples

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes.shoes.black

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes.socks.black

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  <tt>to_buy[1]</tt> is much quicker than <tt>food.produce.fruits.apples</tt>.

<P> Cicada sets are pretty flexible in what they can store.  Along with variables, we can throw constants, other sets (including inlined subsets), and even the void into the bag.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collections :: { men, neighbors, { Patty, Don }, &quot;Herbert&quot;, 3.3, this[3], this, nothing }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Here <tt>collections[3]</tt> is an inlined subset containing two objects.  The fourth and fifth items are inlined constants.  <tt>collections[6]</tt> is basically an alias for the third item, the subset containing <tt>Patty</tt> and <tt>Don</tt>, and notice that it had to be listed after the third item because otherwise <tt>this[3]</tt> would not have existed yet.  <tt>collections[7]</tt> is <tt>collections</tt> itself -- so <tt>collections[7][7][7][2]</tt> is just <tt>neighbors</tt>.  Trying to print <tt>collections</tt> from the command line won&rsquo;t work because of the infinite self reference.

<P> The reason we access set elements by their index (as opposed to name) is that those set elements <i>have no name</i>, at least the way we defined them in our examples.  In other words, <tt>collections[1]</tt> is effectively an alias for <tt>men</tt>, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has the name <tt>men</tt>---typing <tt>collection.men</tt> will cause Cicada to draw a blank.  But there is actually a way to name certain elements of a set, and that is to manually define aliases for their respective objects.  To illustrate, here we give a different way of defining <tt>collections</tt> which assigns names to members 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collections :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbors := @parent.neighbors&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| use same name for convenience

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peeps :: { Patty, Don }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herby := &quot;Herbert&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3,&nbsp;this[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| set elements 5 and 6

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself := @this

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zilch := @nothing

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  With the verbose definition we can write <tt>collections.Herby</tt> in place of <tt>collections[4]</tt>, although <tt>collections[4]</tt> is still perfectly legal.

<P> Just as with composite variables, items can be added to and removed from sets after they have been defined.  So if we want to shuffle &ldquo;<tt>Herbert</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo; to the end of the set we might write:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; collections[top+1] := @collections.Herby

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remove collections.Herby

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P> As with variables, we can use one set to define another.  The following is legal:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newCollections :: collections

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Importantly, <tt>newCollections</tt> is defined using the old set <tt>collections</tt>&rsquo;s <i>original</i> definition.  So even if we had rearranged the elements of <tt>collections</tt>, in the new set <tt>Herbert</tt> will be both at <tt>newCollections[4]</tt> and <tt>newCollections.Herby</tt>.  We might as well have defined both sets on the same line:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newCollections :: collections :: { ... }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P> Here is a tricky situation:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f :: ...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g :: { ; r :: {}, r[+1]:=args[1], return r }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rtrns :: { f(5), f(12), g(3) }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Each set element is a <i>copy</i> of a function&rsquo;s return value, as if it was defined using a <tt>:=</tt> operator.  Normally this is fine, but here <tt>g()</tt>&rsquo;s return value &lsquo;<tt>r</tt>&rsquo; <i>cannot be copied</i> using that operator, because its structure <tt>{int}</tt> doesn&rsquo;t match its original definition <tt>{}</tt>!  In this case we can copy the return value &lsquo;by reference&rsquo; instead, by making an anonymous alias:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rtrns :: { f(5), f(12), @g(3) }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Let&rsquo;s just hope <tt>f()</tt> doesn&rsquo;t have the same problem, because if we alias both <tt>f()</tt> calls then the second call will overwrite the first.  This potential pitfall also lurks in function arguments, since an argument list is simply a set passed into a function.

<P>
