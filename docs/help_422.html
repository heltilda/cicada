<P> 

<P> There&rsquo;s something missing in our scripts, and the easiest place to see this is in an ordinary function call:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(2, pi, { 1, int })

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Realizing that commas are just ends-of-lines, we could write this

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pi

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ 1, int }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  which shows that <tt>2</tt>, <tt>pi</tt>, and <tt>{ 1, int }</tt> are somehow all valid commands.  How can this be?

<P> Let&rsquo;s draw an analogy.  Back in the cave man days, there were probably a lot of sentences like

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rock

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  which in modern English would be written

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [That which I want to draw your attention to] [is] the rock.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  In other words, if a sentence only contains an object, the cave man&rsquo;s brain fills it out by adding some stock subject and verb.  Cicada works exactly the same way:  the stock subjects and verbs to use in different situations are the so-called adapters defined in <tt>cicada.c</tt>.  Each adapter allows the compiler to convert some bare expression (e.g. the object of a sentence) to another type (a full sentence) by throwing in a few extra bytecode words.

<P> When the user enters the command &lsquo;<tt>2</tt>&rsquo;, the compiler rolls its eyes and reaches for the type-mismatch error button, because it a complete command is a type 1 expression whereas an <tt>int_constant</tt> can only be construed as types 4, 5 or 6 based on its return-types string in the <tt>cicadaLanguage[]</tt> array.  But then Cicada notices an adapter that works on type-5 objects (named <tt>type5arg_adapter</tt> in <tt>cicada.c</tt>), and moreover that adapter&rsquo;s return-types string includes a &ldquo;1&rdquo; which is what we want.  So the adapter adds its code and the error never happens.  Here is the adapter&rsquo;s bytecode:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inbytecode &quot;8 173 10&quot; anonymousmember &quot;a1&quot;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  The expression to adapt is considered the argument and goes in place of <tt>a1</tt>.  Looking at <tt>cicada.h</tt> or the reference section, we could figure out that this adapter turns our expression into something looking like

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1 := 2

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  except that the define-equate operator has slightly different define flags (173 instead of 47).

<P> Other types of objects use different adapters when they appear by themselves.  Variables use an adapter that creates an alias:  for example the expression &lsquo;<tt>pi</tt>&rsquo; becomes something like

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var2 := @pi

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  though again using slightly different flags from a normal aliasing operator.  Finally, type-objects are assigned turned into full commands using a third adapter that adds a define-like operator.  Thus &lsquo;<tt>{ 1, int }</tt>&rsquo; turns into a modified version of

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var3 :: { 1, int }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  or more precisely:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var3 :: { var3a := 1, var3b :: int }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P> The <tt>anonymousmember</tt> keyword produces a unique member &lsquo;name&rsquo; that is inexpressible by the user.  (Names become ID numbers in the bytecode:  user-typed names become positive ID numbers, whereas anonymous members get assigned sequential negative ID numbers as they are encountered.  The namespace consists of both the name-ID list and the negative ID counter.)  Thus <tt>var1</tt>, <tt>var2</tt>, etc. in the last paragraph don&rsquo;t really don&rsquo;t have those names or any other, so function <tt>f()</tt> will access those members using the bracket operators (<tt>args[1]</tt>, <tt>args[2]</tt>, etc.).  It&rsquo;s technically possible to write bytecode having hardcoded negative IDs to access anonymous members, but that&rsquo;s a last resort usually used for anonymous members that are also, in the lingo, hidden.

<P> Hidden members are invisible to the array-index operators.  In bytecode-speak, these are produced using define operators whose hidden-member flags are set (flag 6 in Table 3).  The compiler sprinkles anonymous hidden members discreetly around the code for a variety of reasons, where most of them operate almost undetectably.  The one exception:  a hidden-define operator embedded in each function call creates a hidden member in the calling space to store the arguments, which becomes directly visible within the function itself through the pseudo-member <tt>args</tt>.  (Maybe a better notation would show this member explicitly using braces for function calls, as in <tt>f{x, y}</tt>).  The rarest bird of all is the hidden-define-minus-constructor operator (<tt>def-c**</tt> in the table), living exclusively in <tt>trap()</tt> function calls, where it defines the <tt>args</tt> variable <i>without running its constructor</i> so that <tt>trap()</tt> can do so in a controlled way.

<P> The other define-operator flag used by (in this case all) adapters is the unjammable flag (flag 7; see Table 3), which prevents members from jamming arrays.  Consider the function call <tt>f(myArray[&lt;2, 4&gt;])</tt>, which produces a hidden <tt>args</tt> variable consisting of <tt>{ myArray[&lt;2, 4&gt;] }</tt>, which compiles to something like <tt>{ anon1 := @myArray[&lt;2, 4&gt;] }</tt>.  Ordinarily <tt>anon1[]</tt> would jam <tt>myArray[]</tt>, and the actual array could not be resized from either member since doing so would also force a resize of the other.  But in this case <tt>anon1</tt> was defined as unjammable, as in unjam-able (can be unjammed), so any array resize (e.g. <tt>myArray[+3]</tt>) is allowed because the now-out-of-date <tt>anon1</tt> gets de-aliased rather than causing a jammed-member error.  That&rsquo;s OK because the alias will be restored the next time that same function call happens, since the argument constructor will be rerun.  (However there can be a problem in other contexts where the constructor is not rerun each time it is used, for example in sets containing aliases to array subsets.  Use hard-coded aliases for these cases.)  As an aside, these adapters also clear their update-member-type flags (flag 1), so that their anonymous members can be re-assigned to variables of different type (in case, for example, between two iterations of the command <tt>f(a)</tt> member &lsquo;<tt>a</tt>&rsquo; gets removed and redefined).

<P> One last type of adapter called <tt>noarg_adapter</tt> replaces missing expressions altogether.  These adapters are necessary to allow blank scripts, or situations like two consecutive end-of-lines (command-conjoining operators) which lack a command between them to conjoin.  Another no-argument adapter allows a script to contain a <tt>return</tt> command without a variable.  The final set of no-argument adapters in <tt>cicada.c</tt> is used to convert a sentences-type expression (type 1) to a script expression (type 0), by adding a null bytecode word at the end.<P>
