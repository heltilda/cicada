<P> Cicada (formerly Yazoo) originally aimed to be a neural network simulator, missed by a mile, and ended up as a scripting language instead.  As a nod to the original mission, our tutorial will be a program that lets a user create and train artificial neural networks, which are algorithms based on models of we think neurons in our brains work that are widely used for fuzzy tasks such as pattern-recognition.  The time-consuming processes of simulating and training the networks will be written in C, for speed.  (This code is also C++ compatible.)  We will then write Cicada wrappers so that these networks can be controlled at the Cicada command prompt.  Finally, we will write (and debug) a script to use these networks to &lsquo;learn&rsquo; words that the user types at the command prompt.
