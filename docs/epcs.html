<P>Cicada stakes it reputation on its ability to mix and match programming constructs that are ordinarily completely different things.  For example, it doesn't know the difference between a function, a set and a class, because those are all the same object in Cicada.

<P>But -- if one single object can describe x, y and z, then chances are that it can do some strange things in between as well.  What follows is a sampling of unusual raw ingredients that went into the language along with some of their surprising (and unintended) consequences.

<ul>

<li> named elements in function arguments

<br><br><tt>
&nbsp f :: { code, todo = args.op, ... }<br><br>
&nbsp f(3, 5, op := "add")
</tt><br><br>

<li> commands in a function's arguments
<br><br><tt>
&nbsp f(a, print("If you see this, 'a' was passed\n"))
</tt><br><br>

<li> optional parameters in function calls
<br><br><tt>
&nbsp sort(a)<br>
&nbsp sort(b; direction = decreasing)
</tt><br><br>

<li> inheritance (concatenation) of sets
<br><br><tt>
&nbsp primes :: { 2, 3, 5, 7 }<br>
&nbsp odds :: primes : { 1, 9, remove this[1] }
</tt><br><br>

<li> inheritance of <i>functions</i>

<br><br><tt>
&nbsp loop :: {<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp c1 :: int<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp code<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp for c1 in <1, args[1]> &<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp f(c1)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp }<br>
<br><br>
&nbsp count :: loop : {<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp f :: { code, print(c1, " ") }<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp code<br>
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp print("done!\n") &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp }
</tt><br><br>

<li> code substitution

<br><br><tt>
&nbsp (gizmo.part[56] << { code, color = "blue", size = { 2, 3, 1 } })()
</tt><br><br>


</ul>
