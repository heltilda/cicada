<P> A Cicada function has access not only to its own members, but also to members defined at the global level (the workspace).  More generally, the function can access any members along its <i>search path</i>, which goes through any object that encloses the function.  To give a concrete example, we&rsquo;ll define a few functions scattered inside and outside of other objects.

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allFunctions :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stringFunctions :: { ... }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numericFunctions :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theNumber :: double

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raiseToPower :: { code, theNumber := args[1], return new(theNumber^power) }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }&nbsp;&nbsp;}

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; raiseToPowerAlias := @allFunctions.numericFunctions.raiseToPower

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allFunctions.numericFunctions.calcLog :: { ; theNumber = args[1], return new(log(theNumber)) }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerOfThree :: { power := 3 }

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  The simplest case is the search path for the <tt>raiseToPower()</tt> function, which begins at <tt>raiseToPower</tt>, then passes through <tt>numericFunctions</tt> and <tt>allFunctions</tt> and ends at the workspace variable (blue path, Figure 3).  This means that when its code references a member, it looks first in its own space for that member, then if it wasn&rsquo;t found it will back out to <tt>numericFunctions</tt> and look there; etc. all the way to the workspace if necessary.  If it doesn&rsquo;t find the member by the end of its search path it will crash with a member-not-found error.  This search path is used regardless of whether we called <tt>raiseToPower()</tt> or <tt>raiseToPowerAlias()</tt>.

<P> On the other hand, the search path of the <tt>calcLog()</tt> function only touches <tt>calcLog</tt> itself and the workspace variable (the green path in Figure 3).  The reason is that <tt>calcLog</tt> was defined straight from the workspace, <i>not</i> from the code that defined <tt>allFunctions</tt> or <tt>numericFunctions</tt>.  So <tt>calcLog()</tt> cannot find <tt>theNumber</tt>:  it is a broken function.  It&rsquo;s not that the data is inaccessible, it&rsquo;s that we just need to walk the function to where the data lives.  We should have written:

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allFunctions.numericFunctions.calcLog :: {

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theNumber = args[1]

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return new(log(allFunctions.numericFunctions.theNumber))&nbsp;&nbsp;}

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Everyone&rsquo;s door is unlocked, but you have to make a deliberate effort to burgle someone&rsquo;s house other than your own parents&rsquo;.

<P> <br><center><div class="image"><img src="https://heltilda.github.io/cicada/searchPaths.jpg"<div>Figure 3:  Search paths of various functions from an example in the text.  For simplicity we&rsquo;ve named each variable/function box by the member that defined it.  Search paths are shown with heavy arrows:  green arrows for <tt>calcLog()</tt>; light blue arrows for <tt>raiseToPower()</tt>; and purple arrows for <tt>raiseToPower()</tt> function <i>substituted into</i> <tt>powerOfThree()</tt>.  A hypothetical function derived from <tt>raiseToPower()</tt> and specialized by <tt>powerOfThree()</tt> (using the inheritance operator) would have each half its code follow its respective original search path (blue and dotted black arrows from the box at right).</div></div></center><br>

<P> The define operator is special in that it always defines the member right in the first variable of the search path.  So <tt>theNumber</tt> will be defined inside <tt>raiseToPower</tt> even if there is another member called <tt>theNumber</tt> further up the search path.

<P> The notion of a search path gives us a more accurate explanation of code substitution:  that operation just changes the <i>first step</i> on the search path of the substituted code.  Suppose we write

<P> 

<P><P><tt> 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (powerOfThree &lt;&lt; allFunctions.numericFunctions.raiseToPower)(2)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>

<P>

<P>  Then the search path for the substituted function begins at <tt>powerOfThree</tt> but then passes on to <tt>numericFunctions</tt>, <tt>allFunctions</tt>, and the workspace variable just as before.  This is the purple path in Figure 3.  Of course the substitution is temporary, but when the substituted function is run it has a permanent effect on <tt>powerOfThree</tt>:  it creates a member inside of it called <tt>theNumber</tt>.  That member will inherit the spliced search path of the substituted code.
